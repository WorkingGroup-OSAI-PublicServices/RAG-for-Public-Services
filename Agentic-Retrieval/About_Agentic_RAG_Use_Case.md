## Use case: Agentic RAG for Retrieval from Public Sector Documents

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities of Language Model (LLM) applications for public administration. However, applying RAG over public sector documents faces multiple challenges due to complex structure and language of regulatory and legislative texts, institutional documentation, reports, etc. One of the key challenges identified is capturing connections between different sections of documents that have interrelated or complementary information.

> See 'Backlog_RAG_for_Public_Services' for more details about the challenges identified

In that context, one of the use cases proposed by the community is open-source RAG optimised for public sector documents and needs. 

Intoduction of LLM agents into RAG pipelines is a promising strategy to improve accuracy and optimize efficiency of retrieval, especially when working with large libraries of documents.
