# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in the Open-Source AI for Digital Public Goods initiative. This document outlines potential ways you can contribute. As the initiative is still in its early stages, the current focus is on the key areas of work and the primary needs of the project. Detailed guidelines for submitting contributions will be provided in a later iteration of this document.

### Which areas of work you can contribute to? 

1.	***Contributing to the Identification of Priority Use Cases***
-	Do you know of a specific need or bottleneck faced by a public sector institution in your country that could be resolved with generative AI? Are there any specific requirements not met by off-the-shelf generative AI solutions? We would love to hear from you!
-	Ideal Contributors: Public sector employees, policy makers, industry experts, and community leaders.

2.	***Collection of Data for Fine-Tuning and Testing***
-	Data is crucial for refining and testing AI models. If you have access to relevant datasets that can help in fine-tuning our models, your contribution will be invaluable.
-	Ideal Contributors: Data scientists, researchers, academic institutions, and governmental bodies with access to public sector data.

3.	***Contribution of Fully Open-Source Fine-Tuned LLMs and Embedding Models***
-	If you have developed or fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) or embedding models that are fully open-source, contributing them to our initiative can greatly accelerate our progress.
-	Ideal Contributors: AI developers, machine learning researchers, and open-source enthusiasts.

4.	***Development and Optimization of RAG Methods for Public Sector Needs***
-	Research and develop Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods tailored to the unique requirements of public sector applications to enhance efficiency and accuracy.
-	Ideal Contributors: AI researchers, machine learning engineers, and public sector technology experts.

5.	***Optimizing Solutions for Selected Under-Served Languages***
-	Many public sector needs are language-specific. Help us optimize our AI solutions for under-served languages to ensure inclusivity and accessibility.
-	Ideal Contributors: Linguists, AI developers with multilingual expertise, and local language experts.
