# Open-Source AI for Digital Public Goods


### Objective: 
Develop an open-source generative AI solution for public sector use based on clear and transparent standards, integrating state-of-the-art tools and methods, ensuring safety, reliability, and seamless integration with digital public infrastructure.

The solution shall:
- Match commercial performance at a lower cost
- Simplify configuration and maintenance
- Adhere to relevant AI and software standards and best practices

### Context:
The [UN Secretary’s General Roadmap to Digital Cooperation](https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/) outlines a plan for a safer, more equitable digital world. Developed based on extensive consultations with international stakeholders, the Roadmap identifies eight key areas of action, including “Promoting Digital Public Goods (DPGs) to create a more equitable world” and “Supporting global cooperation on artificial intelligence.”

Developing open-source AI for the public sector, grounded in common principles and transparent standards, can serve as a pivotal DPG. This approach can significantly facilitate access to and use of AI technology by public sector institutions, while also promoting international and cross-government cooperation on AI.

Many public sector entities encounter significant obstacles when trying to adopt off-the-shelf generative AI applications. These include administrative challenges, data privacy and ethical concerns, high licensing costs, and issues of control and configurability. At the same time, the ability to leverage AI technology safely and effectively is becoming increasingly important to boost efficiency and deliver better services to citizens, particularly in developing regions where access to essential public goods and services is still limited.

An open-source generative AI solution, compliant with internationally agreed-upon principles and standards, would address these challenges. It would promote global digital cooperation and advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals, ultimately leading to more efficient and equitable service delivery across the globe.

### Scope: 
The initiative will involve:
- Identifying the relevant needs and priority use cases for generative AI in the public sector;
- Defining technical specification and functional requirements;
- Developing an end-to-end blueprint solution based on fully open-source package of tools;
- Collection and curation of data for fine-tuning; 
- Development of custom benchmarks that reflect public-sector needs for performance evaluation;
- Pilot implementation in 2-3 developing countries. 

### Focus: 
Below is a non-exhaustive list of challenges the initiative will attempt to address (this list will likely evolve, after the priority public sector use cases are identified): 
- Underserved languages
- Environmental impact of generative AI
- Issues with retrieval augmented generation over public sector documents
- Reliance on external providers / APIs
- Cost of license and/or maintenance
